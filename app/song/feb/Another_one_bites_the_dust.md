To "bite the dust" means to die or to lose in a contest or game.

The beginning lyrics set up a scene similar to a mobster movie, with "machine guns ready to go".

Later lyrics refer to a failed relationship as "another one bites the dust".

The singer is not going to let it get him down, "standing on my own two feet".
